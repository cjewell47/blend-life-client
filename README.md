# Blend Life Front-end

#### WDI project 4

Created by Charles Jewell

## Project overview

This is the front-end for my fourth WDI project. The app I built was Blend Life which was a platform for people to create and discuss smoothie recipes. 

If you would like to check out the API behind this app, you can view the repository [here](https://github.com/cjewell47/blend-life-api "Blend Life API").

* Connect your Rails back-end to an SQL database and interact with it
* Create at least two models in the SQL database, one being a user model
* Have user authentication where the user's details are stored in the User model in the database
* Create API routes with CRUD functionality using Rails that are to be consumed by the AngularJS front-end
