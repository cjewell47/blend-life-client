        Prasat Suor Prat (Khmer: ប្រាសាទសួព្រ័ត) is a series of twelve towers spanne
        north to south lining the eastern side of royal square in Angkor Thom,
        near the town of Siem Reap, Cambodia. The towers are made from rugged
        laterite and sandstone. The towers are located right in front of
        Terrace of the Elephants and Terrace of the Leper King, flanking the
        start of the road leading east to the Victory Gate, on either side of
        which they are symmetrically arranged. Their function remains unknown.
